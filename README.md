# üëã Hi, I'm Abdullah Bin Omar Chowdhury  
### **Backend Developer | Bringing Ideas to Life with Node.js, TypeScript, Express & MongoDB**


## üë®‚Äçüíª About Me
I'm a 22-year-old Computer Science student and a passionate Backend Developer. I‚Äôm deeply immersed in exploring and mastering the backend world, with a focus on quality, efficiency, and continuous learning. 
My goal is to play a significant role as a software engineer.
I am an enthusiastic learner, continuously improving and eager to dive deeper into the backend world.Programming is not just a career for me‚Äîit‚Äôs a passion, and I‚Äôm obsessed with solving problems and building meaningful, high-quality systems. My journey is about constant growth, embracing challenges, and delivering impactful results. Coding isn't just what I do‚Äîit's what I love.

# My Programming Journey üöÄ

- **Kickoff**:  
  I began my programming journey with C, eager to introduce myself to this amazing universe and master the fundamentals. As I explored each topic, I practiced and solved problems based on what I learned, using various online judges. Once I felt my fundamentals were strong enough, I moved on to C++ to dive into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). While C posed some challenges with DSA, C++ offered cleaner and easier syntax, making the learning process smoother. Through C++, I recapped my fundamentals and honed my problem-solving skills on online platforms.  

- **Exploring DSA and Problem Solving**:  
  Once I felt comfortable with my fundamentals and C++ syntax, I started learning Data Structures. I focused on understanding each topic thoroughly, practicing and solving problems as I went along. For a greater challenge, I participated in coding contests. With time, I covered all the essential DSA topics for a beginner, ensuring I understood them well. Before implementing any solution, I would first use pen and paper to draw diagrams, write steps, and outline potential solutions. When I felt confident, I moved on to the next phase of my journey‚Äîdevelopment.  

# Development Journey üíª  

- **Initiated with HTML and CSS**:  
  I started my development journey by learning HTML and exploring how to structure a website. I practiced on W3Schools and SoloLearn, gaining confidence with HTML tags before moving on to CSS. I explored the syntax, attributes, and how to integrate CSS with HTML, step by step. Once I felt confident, I built simple projects using HTML and CSS and then moved forward.  

- **Introduction to JavaScript and DOM Manipulation**:  
  Having started with C, I quickly grasped JavaScript and fell in love with it. I revisited the fundamentals, including modern JavaScript and ES6 features, sharpening my skills. Once confident in the syntax, I focused on learning how to integrate JavaScript with HTML and explored DOM manipulation. To deepen my understanding, I read documentation and practiced projects such as adding like/comment features, modals, and navigation bars. As I became proficient with the DOM, I moved on to API integration using the fetch API and worked with fake APIs. This hands-on experience strengthened my understanding of working with raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Feeling deeply connected with JavaScript, I confidently moved forward.  

- **Introduction to Bootstrap and Tailwind**:  
  Raw CSS can be time-consuming, so I explored Bootstrap first and completed several projects. Eventually, I transitioned to Tailwind CSS, as it offered greater flexibility and customization with its utility-first approach compared to Bootstrap's component-based framework.  

- **Introduction to Python and OOP**:  
  To learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), I turned to Python. It was quicker for me to learn compared to JavaScript due to its simplicity, and my foundation in C made the transition easier. After gaining confidence in Python's syntax, I began practicing OOP principles. I worked on terminal-based projects such as a cinema hall system, ticket booking, and bank management system to deepen my understanding of OOP. Once confident, I moved on to the next phase.  

- **SQL: Organizing Life with MySQL**:  
  I chose SQL for its structured and organized approach. Since my backend journey was set to begin with Django, which highly recommends SQL, I started exploring SQL by practicing queries and solving problems to solidify my understanding. Alongside SQL, I explored MySQL and was impressed by its capabilities. Once confident, I moved forward to learning Django.  

- **Django and Django REST Framework (DRF)**:  
  I began with Django due to its "batteries included" approach, starting with the MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture. I built projects such as a bank management system and library management system using Django‚Äôs built-in session-based authentication. I then explored DRF but found it a bit more complex, and I felt that I couldn‚Äôt connect with Django anymore, so I decided to end my journey with it and moved on.  

- **Advanced and Modern Frontend**:  
  After stepping away from Django, I spent some time learning React, diving deep into its fundamentals and practicing them. As I continued my journey in JavaScript, I felt myself getting closer to the JS ecosystem. I worked on practice projects, integrating fake APIs, and, when confident, moved forward.  

- **Backend with Node, Express, and Mongoose**:  
  My love for JavaScript led me to explore Node.js, where I built servers and gained a deeper understanding of its fundamentals. I then explored Express, which resonated with me. I realized that Express gave me the freedom to approach backend development in my own way, and that was exactly what I had been looking for. I integrated Mongoose with Express and began building basic APIs, diving deeper into the backend world. Once I became confident in creating basic APIs, I moved forward.  

- **MERN Stack and Career Decision**:  
  As I became proficient in backend development with Node, Express, and Mongoose, I integrated them into full-stack projects, focusing on the MERN stack. Alongside this, I improved my backend skills and learned token-based authentication with JWT and bcrypt. However, I realized that frontend development wasn‚Äôt for me. My heart and mind told me that backend development was my true calling, and I made the decision to pursue a career as a backend software engineer or backend specialist.  

- **Deep Dive into Backend and Current Position**:  
  With a clear career goal in mind, I set a path to achieve it. I began learning TypeScript and integrating it with Node, Express, and Mongoose, practicing how to apply TypeScript in real-world scenarios. Now, I continue to build on my backend expertise and move closer to my goal.
