### 📚 My Journey in Programming

- **Getting Started with Problem Solving:**  
  My journey began with **C** and **C++**, solving countless challenges on competitive platforms like Codeforces, LeetCode, HackerRank, and CodeChef. This experience strengthened my foundation in programming and deepened my passion for the tech industry.

- **Diving into Data Structures and Algorithms:**  
  To understand complex topics, I took on a range of problems on platforms such as Codeforces and LeetCode. Mastering **DSA** concepts allowed me to develop a well-rounded understanding of efficient programming techniques.

- **Front-End Development:**  
  I started with **HTML** and **CSS** to build static web pages, later enhancing my skills with **Bootstrap** and **Tailwind CSS**. I applied these skills in various projects, creating responsive and visually appealing web designs.

- **JavaScript & DOM Manipulation:**  
  Learning **JavaScript** and **DOM manipulation** opened up a whole new level of interactivity in my projects. Working with fake APIs, I could build dynamic user interfaces and practice real-world scenarios.

- **SQL and Database Management:**  
  To manage data, I learned **SQL** and **MySQL**, providing me with the skills to design and work with relational databases.

- **Python and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):**  
  Learning **Python** allowed me to deepen my understanding of OOP principles. I developed command-line-based projects like Cinema Hall and Bank Management systems, applying Python and OOP to practical scenarios.

- **Exploring Django:**  
  My journey with **Django** introduced me to the MVT architecture, allowing me to build structured applications like Library Management and Bank Management systems. While I found **Django** complex, the experience was invaluable in learning backend web development.

- **React and the MERN Stack:**  
  I transitioned to **JavaScript** frameworks and libraries, starting with **React**. I then expanded to **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**, which led me to the full **MERN stack**. I now enjoy the versatility and synergy of the JavaScript ecosystem, building full-stack applications that seamlessly integrate both front-end and back-end.

### ⚙️ Technologies & Tools

- **Languages:** C, C++, JavaScript, Python, SQL
- **Front-End:** HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, React
- **Back-End:** Node.js, Express.js, Django
- **Database:** MongoDB, MySQL
- **Others:** Git, GitHub, REST APIs, MERN Stack, Mongoose

### 🌱 Currently Learning
I'm continually expanding my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest in web development and backend technologies. Right now, I’m focusing on deepening my understanding of the JavaScript ecosystem, exploring advanced topics in React, Node.js, and MongoDB.
